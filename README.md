# The-Magic-8-Ball
The Magic 8 Ball game is a playful Python program that simulates the classic fortune-telling toy. When launched, it prompts the user to ask any yes-or-no question, then draws from a preset list of mysterious responses like “Yes, definitely,” “Ask again later,” or “Outlook not so good.” Using Python’s random module, the program selects one of these answers at random, adding an element of surprise and fun to each interaction. The core of the game is a loop that allows users to keep asking questions until they choose to type “quit,” gracefully ending the session with a farewell message. Overall, my Magic 8 Ball project demonstrates how simple Python logic can be transformed into an engaging interactive experience—mixing randomness with user input to keep things whimsical and dynamic.
